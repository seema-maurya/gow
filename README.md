- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests cover the interaction between different components or modules.


## Database Connection

The project uses MongoDB as the database. To connect to the database, a `Database` class is implemented in the `database.js` file. This class provides methods to establish a connection to the MongoDB database and retrieve the database instance.

### Code Snippet

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

class Database {
  constructor(uri, dbName) {
    this.uri = uri;
    this.dbName = dbName;
    this.client = new MongoClient(this.uri);
    this.db = null;
  }

  async connect() {
    try {
      await this.client.connect();
      this.db = this.client.db(this.dbName);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async getDb() {
    if (!this.db) {
      throw new Error("Database connection has not been established.");
    }
    return this.db;
  }
}

const uri = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority";
const dbName = "<dbname>";

const database = new Database(uri, dbName);

// Export a function to connect to the database and return the database instance
async function connectDatabase() {
  await database.connect();
  return database;
}

module.exports = { connectDatabase };
```

const io = new Server(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('A user connected');
  socket.on('message', (msg) => {
    console.log(`Message received: ${msg}`);
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
